trying to figure out how KilledByAPixel's 'Bitwise Liminal' 256b demo works by manually decompressing the code...

- original: [live demo](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/TinyCode/256B/BitwiseLiminal/), [source](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/TinyCode/blob/master/256B/BitwiseLiminal/index.html)
- expanded: [live demo](https://callumlocke.com/bitwise-liminal-expanded/), [source](./index.html)

---
notes
- mine seems to have a faster playback speed; not sure if I messed something up or it just got faster due to the code being less condensed?
- i don't understand the maths parts, but the structure is clearer now
- KilledByAPixel is amazing, see his [other demos](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/TinyCode/)
